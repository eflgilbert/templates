# Updates for Year 2018

## July 2-6
<pre>
Hi Cory,

Sorry this is late, I literally fell asleep over my dinner last night, but I got to sleep in this morning!

Here is my update for this week.

SDS/BSR Project
Last week’s goals:
		- <s>Run cart on A8 and small grains Friday</s> <b> Done. Was very fun.</b>
		- <s>Do handheld measurements in Rosemount on Thursday (Hopefully the Kurle Lab handheld will be in)</s> <b> Done. Kurle handheld wasn’t in yet.</b>
	- Work with stressed plant tissue
		- <s>See if pixel labels can be transferred and combined from different users</s> <b> They can, but exporting the pixels is still unstable</b>
	
Next week’s goals:
	- Field Growth Chamber
		- Handheld in Rosemount on Thursday (Hopefully the Kurle Lab handheld will be in)
		- Scan growth chamber BSR plants on indoor scanner on Friday
	- Work with stressed plant tissue
		- Have Khoa look at the cart scans from Friday, July 6th, to see if we need to make any adjustments with the cart
		- Try to run some code to work with the successfully labeled rgb images we got from the pixel labeling
		- See if existing pipelines can identify plants in the pseudo rgb images
		


PhD Progress Overall
Last week’s goals:
	- Track down Don Wyse to ask about seminar attendance <b>He is harder to track than I thought</b>

Next week’s goals:
	- Lab meeting presentation on publication chosen by Cory

	- Start thinking about my thesis proposal and make a list of what I can do to try to get started early on some other chapters that will take a while to complete.



Master’s Publication
Last week’s goals:
	- <s>Meet with Ben on Thursday (talk specifically about figures for the final publication) </s> <b>Field work got in the way but we caught up over email</b>
	- Double check recurrent and donor parent info <b>Almost done</b>
	- Run code with double checked input files <b>Will run over weekend</b>

Next week’s goals:
	- Run code with double checked lines

Hi Erin,
Thank you for the update. 

Regarding tracking Don down, just send him an email briefly stating what you want to talk to him about and set up a meeting. Trying to just find him isn’t a good use of your time. Hopefully you can just do it over email and never even need to spend time meeting with him.

Rosemount: If the Kurle lab hyperspec is here this week or if not, I would like you to start taking 2 measurements from each plant. We talked before about the tissue to select (top 3rd of plant so it isn’t a senescing leaf and not from the very top so it is a not a super young leaf). We want the tissue to be as close in develop as possible throughout time so we aren’t just picking up life stage changes. Because of this variation I think it is important to get 2 readings from each plant.

Hyperspectral Images: We have got to get this moving somehow. We have spent too much time (a year) on this type of data to not have any data analysis done. We are not completing deliverables for sponsored projects that are paying both you and me and that needs to change or we will not keep getting money. You really need to focus as much effort as you can to segmentation from hyperspectral images. As we talked last week, work with the small set of annotated images from MatLab to see if this is a promising technique. It seems very unstable and might not scale for us well, but you have invested some time so lets give it a fair shake. Also, how much experience with PlantCV did you get from Phenome last year? I’ve talked to Malia and we might want to try it with your RGB images to have it do the segmentation for you. They have a naive bayes classifier that might work for our needs. Look into this this week and see if we can start to implement this technique. Lets talk about this though early this week. It might be a more user-friendly machine learning technique than MatLab’s. Main theme: we need to complete this as soon as we can. I’m really hoping in the next week or two this is a resolved issue. 

Thesis proposal: See above (hyperspectral images). We need to get this images segmented before anything else. Once that is satisfactorily done then you can move on to thinking about other projects.

Master’s thesis: Finishing projects will always be frustrating, but it is something that you need to do, not only for yourself to show an output to people, but also to show collaborators that you finish projects that you started. How you get to that completion though varies. If you are varying on what work needs to be done then you need to communicate that with Ben. Tell him your thoughts and listen to why he thinks you need to redo everything. I also really think you need to explain to him that this isn’t your main focus anymore and you can only spend X amount (let me know if you need me to fill in this X for you) of hours a week on completing this. You need to convey that if he wants all this redone it is going to take time and not get done right away. You have other responsibilities you need to balance. Explain to him your thoughts and go from there. We can talk about this more in person if you would like.

Extracurriculars: So you are basically not around Friday, do you not only have GSB meetings during the academic semesters?

Lets touch base early this week before you go to Rosemount for a day and aren’t really around Friday so you can be as productive as possible in the limited hours you have this week to work on your thesis data analysis.

Hi Cory,

It was the week of seminars and presentations, and I didn’t get anything done the first half of the week. I was able to get pretty focussed in the latter half of the week, though.	

SDS/BSR Project
Last week’s goals:
- Keep working with stressed plant tissue
	- Create files that contain the different channels of the k-means results (SDS round 1 only) and have Sydney manually pick out channels for each image. <b>The code works for this, but MSI is having license issues (too many people trying to use it at once). I'm going to start running these things overnight or on weekends</b>.
	- <s>See if I can shorten the queue time MSI for Matlab</s> <b>Cory helped. Have to reduce the amount of memory requested.</b>
- Work with Undergrads
	- Sydney:
		- <s>Help her with computer stuff. She struggles with computer literacy, so I kind of backed off on getting her to do things like back scans up. We have been working on practicing the things I have already taught her, so I think I can add one new task every two/three weeks or so.</s> <b>Worked on this a little bit. Talked about scans and </b>
		- <s>Meet with Cory to talk about the scoring methods</s> <b>Cory suggested some qualitative notes</b>
	- Khoa: <s>Keep in touch about the cart images.</s> <b>He seems to be doing ok</b>
	- Evan: <s>Help him out with stuff when he needs it.</s> <b>Helped him with figuring out how to loop through all raw files in a directory</b>
- <s>Make sure all backups are up-to date</s> <b>Had to delete some of my stuff off the hyperspec computer. Made sure Tier 2 was up to date.</b>

Next week’s goals:
- Keep working with stressed plant tissue
	- Create files that contain the different channels of the k-means results (SDS round 1 only) and have Sydney manually pick out channels for each image.
	- Check in with Grace about ordering seed
- Work with Undergrads
	- Sydney:
		- Train her more on the hyperspec (taking dark and white references). I’m going to print out the how-to guide and tape it to the hyperspec monitor table in the lab.
		- Have her score round 1 of kmeans = 5 channel images
	- Khoa: Keep in touch about the cart images. 
	- Evan: Help him out with stuff when he needs it.

PhD Progress Overall
Last week’s goals:
- Make changes to thesis proposal draft <b>Working on this now. Mendeley is giving me some trouble on my computer.</b>
- <s>Do more safety trainings,</s> try to get them all done to reach maximum safety level 
- <s>Re-evaluate how much time I am setting aside for reading/writing</s> <b>Thought a lot about "protecting my time.” I’ve started to tell people “no” to a lot of optional things.</b>
- <s>Check the office for stuff that might need to go into the inventory</s> <b>Had Sydney work on this.</b>
- <s>Meet with Peter to go over the grade book</s> <b>This went about as well as expected</b>
- Added goal: <s>Ask Grace about next growth chamber round</s> <b>She hasn’t really thought about it. I need to bug her more.</b>
- Added goal: <s>Ask Grace about ordering seed for field plots</s> <b>Almost all of it has been collected. We still need seed from 3 or 4 varieties, she said.</b>

Next week’s goals:
- Go to Peter’s final and make sure all grades are in
- Do more safety trainings, try to get them all done to reach maximum safety level 
- Try to finish up thesis proposal to send out the following week

Hi Cory,

I felt really productive in the lab this week, but didn’t get as much writing done as I wanted. I need to start setting aside more time for reading/writing.

- Keep working with stressed plant tissue
	- Create files that contain the different channels of the k-means results and have Sydney manually pick out channels for each image. 
	- Added goal: <s>Get MSI working with Matlab.</s> <b>I got the code to run on MSI without it being shut down. Ended up being a memory allocation issue. They are spending a long time in the queue though.</b>

I will also introduce her to the field cart data and how it differs from the indoor. <b>We didn’t get to do this but we talked more about how we want to do scans. The BSR plants are getting big so we strategized how we will image them as they grow.</b>
  - Evan: <s>Help him out if he has questions about MatLab. As an aside, his computer runs MatLab incredibly slow.</s> <b>We worked together to identify seeds in one of his barley images. We talked about RGB and greyscale images and I showed him how to QC his stuff. We also talked about taking notes.</b>
  - Khoa: <s>Start meetings with Khoa to talk about field images.</s> Maybe pull in Sydney for QC after extraction finalized?
- Order seed if/when Grace chooses the lines <b>She never mentioned it</b>
-Work more with the blue mats to answer the following requests from Cory: 
  1. do they help data extraction
  2. if they can be cleaned and reused (that would be great)

Hi Erin,
I’m glad to hear you making and are continuing to make more progress on your research. A couple of things. I think Sydney is very capable, but remember it is your responsibility to make sure your data is being collected and collected properly. Keep in mind that she is still fresh in doing this and will need to be eased into it, letting her take more responsibility is great, but you have to make sure she is doing it well. Also, make sure that a goal for early next week is to take a look at the hand held field data as we talked about last week. I didn’t see that as one of your goals so please don’t forget to prioritize that. Thanks.

Hi Cory,

This week I felt like I could start to do a little more work than I have the past few weeks. I have focused a lot on trying to see the big picture of my project. Next week is also pretty clear, so I am hoping to continue picking up the pace on my work.


SDS/BSR Project
Last week's goals:

Hi Erin,
Seems like all your weeks are crazy weeks. I think you are seeing that you need to be able to use all your time appropriately when you have these weeks. You will have to be able to jump in and out of things without requiring hours of time chunks to get into things. Have to have a plan ahead of time. Also, start trying to frame some bigger picture headers like we talked about before to keep things in context for yourself. Since we probably don’t have much research wise to talk about Monday I can look through your outline of your proposal. Have a good rest of the weekend. Thanks.

Hi Cory,
 
Last week was a bit of a mess because of the Plant Sciences Symposium. I'm really glad it's out of the way. I've been trying to practice getting in half an hour of work here or there so I can still make progress during busy weeks.

I thought this week went pretty well. It was nice to not have classes. I am feeling really worn down, though, so I took a half day off today.

LAST WEEK’S GOALS:
- <s>Get Matlab code up and running and do comparison between that and the R code I really like Matlab.</s> <b>It is much faster. I think we should move forward with Matlab for extractions and R for analysis. We can talk more in person if you want. </b>
- <s>Turn in MnDRIVE</s>
- <s>Finish grading for Peter’s lab</s>
- Rerun extractions for all 3 growth chamber rounds with the soil masking protocol and generate qc pngs with rgb added. <b>I will be working on this over the weekend. I almost have the code ready to go as of 10pm Friday.*</b>

Not going to lie. Next week is going to be a nightmare. The Plant Sciences Symposium is going on Thursday and Friday and I am on the committee for that. I will be unreachable all Thursday afternoon and all of Friday. I will try to get as much done as possible over this weekend. But between that, TAing Peter’s lab, and Monday meetings, I really don’t have as much research time as I would like.

NEXT WEEK’S GOALS:
- Plant BSR GC
- Start doing statistical analyses on Matlab extractions
- Extracurricular tasks (so we can keep track of what's going on in off-work hours): IT for Plant Science Symposium (~15 hrs, including outside of work hours), Meet with Hennepin County to discuss Hennepin/CFANS collaboration(1hr), Orthodontist (1hr)

*I have already figured out passing the arguments to the code so I can integrate it with the job task array I have on MSI. I think my immediate challenge is to get the Matlab code to identify and extract individual objects. I know Tara did it with PCs, but I need to look over her code again. Maybe it can be something we talk about on Monday in our methods meeting.

## March 5-9

Hi Cory,

I must have forgotten to mention that in my "other" hour estimations I try to include the prep/travel time. For instance, the root canal crown will only take ~30 minutes in the dental chair, but I factor in time on the connector to make it 1.5 hours.

My research to-do list is short because I've noticed the last few weeks that I keep moving major stuff from the "LAST WEEK" bin to the "NEXT WEEK" bin with little progress for each. It's very frustrating for me to notice myself fall into that pattern. My attempt to stop it is to try to focus really hard on the next few steps for 1 or 2 days to try to build momentum. If I keep adding small things to my checklist I'll focus on those and pat myself on the back at the end of the week when really I should be focusing on my thesis research. I do want to achieve more next week, but I want to make sure to prioritize those two goals on Mon/Tue.

Maybe I should create categories for major and minor goals for each week.

I do agree I am slow on my research progress and I want to pick up speed. I've been working on making sure I get in earlier and leave work later as well. Now I need to make sure to maximize my productivity in those hours. I'm looking forward to not having class next week. But yes, I do feel like my focus has been waning. I'll make sure to get back on top of things.

Thanks again,
Erin

Hi Erin,
Thank you for the weekly update. It seems you made some progress on things this past week and things are moving in the right direction. Thank you for keeping me up-to-date with the ‘others’ in your schedule, it seems like every week you have ~8hrs, outside of TAing, of extra things, which seems to be just meeting times, not including any travel or prep for them. How are you feeling about that extra workload? As next week is spring break you really need to make more progress on your research tasks this week. I’m hoping you can accomplish a bit more than what you have outlined for next week. This current project funding ends at the end of April and you need to make more progress to accomplish a bit more of our deliverables to the growers so we can have a more robust end of project report. Hope you are having a good weekend, thanks.

Hi Erin,
I would like to keep our biweekly meetings as a more high level meeting big picture or papers or things discussion. I want this other meeting at 9am for me to look through what you are working on, ask questions, provide more focused feedback and things like that. I hope that makes sense. For these meetings at 9am be ready to show notes of how you are doing things and things for me to look at that you are making progress on. I will leave the format this is in up to you and I’ll suggest alternatives if I think it would make for more meaningful discussions. Thanks.

Thank you for the update. I hope you had a rewarding time at ISU to end the week. It seems like you are making progress on things. I want to start helping move things along for us and help to set priorities and goals for you. I also need to keep up with what you are doing in terms of research, not just the big picture you are working on, but I need to stay more up to date with how things are being done, how things are coded, how can I help and add. This will help us stay on track and will hopefully lessen the surprises down the road. I would like us to find a time that both of us can meet every week, a recurring 1-1.5hr meeting. Offer some times and we will get something on the calendar. I would like us to start this next week. Thats all I have for now, have a good rest of the weekend.

Hi Cory,

I will definitely prioritize the masking. I had a great time at Phenome and met a lot of people. Just a reminder, this week is when the Monsanto people are here to select the Monsanto fellowship winners. I can’t make it to the lunch because of TAing, and Don said last nights there were openings. I will be able to make it to the big session at 3:30.

Thanks,
Erin

Hi Erin,
Thank you for the update. Masking the plants is definitely a difficult task that is really important for us to find a good, robust method to use. It will take some playing around, but I think you have several options to start trying. Please prioritize this over anything else regarding this analysis (over pcas), because if we don’t have good starting data then the downstream analysis doesn’t really mean anything. Also, let me know if Vahid contacts you about anything so we can stay on top of that.

I hope you had a good time at phenome and thought it was a good use of time for you. I like going to conferences as they give me new ideas for research and get me energized to get our current research out. I was happy to see you meeting and talking with people you didn’t know originally, hopefully that was fruitful for you as well. I can help you with your reimbursement later this week if you would like. Thanks.

Hi Cory,

Work this week was a little slow because of Phenome. Here is my update.

THIS WEEK’S GOALS:
- Get Perl Script to output what Vahid wants 
	<b>Vahid confirmed he received the code. The shared folder with Vahid does not have any new files, so I am not sure he has run it yet.</b>
- Think about ways to standardize colors for hyperspec-to-RGB image algorithm  
	<b>There are two solutions. In the workshop at Phenome, I learned that my image is probably dark because I did not apply a gamma correction. I am going to try to implement that in to the R code. I also talked to the software guy from Middleton and he said he can write some Matlab code for me that would quickly produce a color image using two channels. Sara also told me she has some Matlab code for this.</b>
- The QC images showed that a lot of soil is getting picked up with the smaller plants. I found an NDVI index which takes into account soil. I would like to run some test extractions to see if those profiles can be cleaned up. 
	<b>The new index doesn’t work. I will have to think of other ways to mask out the soil. I think getting an RGB image and masking out the brown might be the easiest, though I foresee the white flecks in the soil to continue giving us problems.</b>
- <s>Find a new place to backup scans. The hyperspec computer was full, so I had to delete some scans that were already backed up not he Hirsch_Lab_2 external hard drive. This means we now only have scans in 1 place where they are guaranteed to not be deleted anytime soon. Our original goal was 3 places.</s>  
	<b>Everything we have taken so far is going to be pushed up to our home drive on MSI. Didn’t have time to move it all off of H_L_2 before I left for Phenome and I didn’t want to take the drive to AZ.</b>
- Scan every day until Monday. Tuesday I have to fly to Phenome. 
	<b>Didn’t get a scan on Tuesday, but this round is very different from the previous two anyways. Will have to start looking at the differences between rounds and think about how to compare data between them.</b>
- <s>GO TO PHENOME. Learn at workshop, present poster, represent lab.</s> 
	<b>At Phenome right now. Making a lot of friends, meeting up with past friends, and learning a lot.</b>


NEXT WEEK’S GOALS:
- Get RGB images generated. Would be a good addition to the QC images.
- Continue trying to improve masking out soil.
- Start pulling apart the PCA trait table data and categorize the wavelengths by effect on each day.
- Peter is ramping up my tasks for TAing. I have more grading to do and I am now managing the lab quizzes on Canvas. We also talked about some students we are concerned about. I am learning a lot about how to deal with students as an instructor.
- Extracurricular tasks (so we can keep track of what's going on in off-work hours): Artemisia seminar (1 hr), running COGS presidential elections (2 hrs/week), Plant Sciences Symposium IT phone call (30 min), UMN Legislative Kick Off Breakfast(1.5 hrs in early morning), I got nominated for the President's Student Leadership and Service Awards (PSLSA) so I have to fill out something for that (1.5 hrs).
- Start thinking about setting up the field trials and talk to Jim Kurle about it again.


Thanks,
Erin

Hi Erin,
Hopefully you are in a pretty good place with your fellowship. Let me know today when I can look at it. I want to be able to make comments with enough time for you to make changes before the submission deadline.

Hi Cory,

Last week was a bit of a cluster. I realized TAing is going to take up pretty much all of Tuesdays, so that’s a bummer.  The main thing is, I have all members of my committee chosen and spoken to. We also got round 3 plants and in the chamber. I culled the seedlings over the weekend down to 1 per pot. This week is going to be focusing on Monsanto (Due Wednesday) and Phenome Poster (First draft by Friday).


Thanks,
Erin
