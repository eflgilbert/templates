# Templates and Documentation Samples

This repository contains examples of project documentation and templates used to maintain uniformity amongst projects.

## Documentation

Most projects are tracked through an RMarkdown (RMD) document which outputs an HTML in order to view plots and tables more easily. HTMLs must be downloaded and opened in a browser. Rmd files can be viewed in this github repository, or may be downloaded and run in RStudio.

### RMDs Included

Apogee_rosemount_summer_2017 - Notes on a field experiment performed in Rosemount, MN in the summer of 2017. An apogee handheld hyperspectrometer was used to take measurements.

Notes_morex_project - a side project involving scanning barley accessions for another group, extraqcting the relevant hyperspectral pixels, and providing the normalized data to the collaborators.

Weekly_update_log_efg - a sample of weekly updates over the course of six months sent to my PI


## Templates 

Most scripts start off as a copy of one of the below templates to maintain uniformity.

<b>Supercomputer submission shell script</b> - In order to run a script on the UMN cluster, a shell script must be submitted. The template here includes metadata that should be sent to initialize the job as well as syntax for running R, Python, or MATLAB scripts.

<b>rmd (HTML)</b>- These are HTML reports of the RMarkdown files with the same name. These reports include images, tables, and plots as well as written notes.

<b>rmd (Shiny/Slidly) </b>- A sample of an RShiny Markdown file that was written as a way to explore the possibility of having interactive plots/figures in a presentation.

<b>Rscript/MATLAB/Python </b>- These files are used as starting points for most of the scripts written. This is to ensure all scripts have the same basic information and structure.
